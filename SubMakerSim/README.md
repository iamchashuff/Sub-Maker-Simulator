## Sub Maker Simulator
Simply put, this program was created to help myself gain familiarity with Publix deli ingreditents. 
I had started working there and wanted to help myself study while also practicing programming.

Currently, there is a small bug where the JRadio buttons clear, but do not uncheck themselves after each sub order is submitted.
This means you will have to remember to click each ingredient every time, despite a box appearing as if it were checked.
